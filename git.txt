Hello,

I was trying to upload files to a remote directory to replace the files that were there.

This is what I did in the git bash:

   94  cd clarify
   95  git init
   96  git add -A
   97  git commit -m "code with new sthlp files"
   98  git remote add origin git@github.com:iqss-research/clarify
   99  git push
  100  git push --set-upstream origin master
  101  git remote add origin https://github.com/iqss-research/clarify.git
  102  git remote rm origin
  103  git remote add origin https://github.com/iqss-research/clarify.git
  104  git remote -v
  105  git push
  106  git push --set-upstream origin master
  107  git push --set-upstream origin master -f


At this point I realized that I had lost the previous history of commits. I tried the git reflog but it doesn't tell me what was there. How can I get the commits back?

Thanks,

Zagreb
